# Tasks
This is the repository for SCIT tasks

The tasks have been done by using matplotlib,numpy libraries in python.
 
## Question1

The first subtask was to plot histogram for 1000 samples generated using numpy.random.poisson() function 3 times.
A set of random 1000 samples is selected using the numpy.random.poisson() function 
The **mean** used for poisson distribution is **5**.

The graph plotted by the points generated by the function numpy.random.poisson follows the poisson distribution, 
the probability rapidly approaches 0 as X increases

## Question2
The second question was to plot histogram for 1000 samples generated using numpy.random.normal() function 3 times.
A set of random 1000 samples is selected using the numpy.random.normal() function 
The **mean** used for normal distribution is **5** and the **standard deviation** is **1**.

The graph plotted by the points generated by the function numpy.random.normal follows the normal distribution, 
the histogram plotted is symmetric to the mean thereby creating the bell curve.


## Question 3
The question was to plot the average of 100 random points generated by the normal and poisson function and to repeat the experiment
100 times.
The **mean** and **std.deviation** selected for normal and poisson functions are **5** and **1**,100  points are taken
at random from the normal and poisson distribution, then their average is taken and the histogram is plotted.

The 100 graphs generated are very similar to each other, the mean of the average histogram also has mean very close to the mean 
of poisson and normal distributions.
